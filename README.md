# Bitbox
ios / android app for securely storing password/other data
the app encrypts all the data using AES 256 encryption
All data is stored in a realm database file, supporting native encryption.
All data can be backed up / restored using google drive integration api built into the code,
code implements Google Drive REST API for storing data.
Data is stored in the users google drive, inside the appData folder normally hidden
to the user.

The app is supposed to provide a free and secure password manager with great UI experience.
I have planned featured such as beam to chrome tabs, etc. in the future
